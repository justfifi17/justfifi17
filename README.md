# 👋 Hey there, I'm Fithi!  or you can call me Jessiii 😉
I’m here to challenge the flow, not settle in it. I love exploring new ideas, pushing the boundaries of tech, and shaping my own journey. To me, tech is the ultimate tool for curiosity, a way to keep learning, creating, and growing at my own pace.

## 💡 A Few Fun Facts
- ☕ **Tea Connoisseur in the Making**: There’s something about a good cup of tea—it fuels my learning marathons and creative coding sessions.
- 🎶 **Music Whisperer**: Music isn’t just sound to me; it’s a language, a taste, a sensation. I feel every note, every beat, and each melody as if it’s speaking to me.  
- 📖 **Bookworm & Animation Buff**: You might catch me with a book or engrossed in an animated film, somewhere between Python scripts and SQL queries.
- 🎹 **Aspiring Chess & Piano Maestro**: One day, I’ll play piano and strategize in chess like a pro. Consider it a work in progress!

## 🛠 Tech Stack Love Affair
- 💻 SQL, PL/SQL, and Python are my tools of choice. They’re powerful, versatile, and, just like tech, filled with endless potential for creativity and problem-solving.

### 😄
Did you hear about the SQL query that walked into a bar?  
It couldn’t stop joining tables!  

…and that’s pretty much my approach too: always connecting the dots, finding relationships, and digging into data!

## 🏆 Challenge Accepted!
These are some of my current coding goals. I love learning and pushing myself, so consider these as “achievements in progress”:

- [ ] Master the art of Python one-liners 🐍  
- [ ] Deploy an AI model that recognizes tea brands 🍃  
- [ ] Code something that plays my favorite melodies 🎶  
- [ ] Get my GitHub green square game strong! 💪
