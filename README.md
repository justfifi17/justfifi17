  Curiosity and creativity are my compass, and I believe tech is the ultimate playground for turning ideas into reality. I love exploring new ideas, pushing tech boundaries, and shaping my own path forward. To me, tech isn’t just a career; it’s a way to keep learning, creating, and growing.
  
  As a Master’s student in Computer Science, I'm always building on my foundation, aspiring to dive deeper into data engineering, machine learning and software. With each project and discovery, I’m working toward making a meaningful impact in myself and the tech world.

  ## 💡 A Few Fun Facts
  - ☕ **Tea Connoisseur in the Making**: Tea is my fuel and therapy! A good cup of tea makes my day enjoyable and productive. 
  - 🎶 **Music Whisperer**: Music isn’t just sound to me; it’s a language, a taste, a sensation. I feel every note, every beat, and each melody as if it’s speaking to me.  
  - 📖 **Bookworm & Movies Buff**: If I’m lost in a book or movie, don’t count on me to save you from any “oops” moments, I’m in the zone!
  - 🎹 **Aspiring Chess & Piano Maestro**: One day, I’ll play piano and strategize in chess like a pro. Consider it a work in progress!
  - ⌨️ **Neat Freak**: Clean code, neat spaces, everything in its place.

  ## 🛠 Tech Stack Love Affair
  - 💻 SQL and Python are my tools of choice. They’re powerful, versatile, and, just like tech, filled with lots of potential for creativity and problem-solving.
