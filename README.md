  Curiosity and creativity are my compass, and I believe tech is the ultimate playground for turning ideas into reality. I love exploring new ideas, pushing tech boundaries, and shaping my own path forward. To me, tech isn‚Äôt just a career; it‚Äôs a way to keep learning, creating, and growing.
  
  As a Master‚Äôs student in Computer Science, I'm always building on my foundation, aspiring to dive deeper into data engineering, machine learning and software. With each project and discovery, I‚Äôm working toward making a meaningful impact in myself and the tech world.
